4. Activate the virtual environment by running `.\env\Scripts\activate`
5. Upgrade pip by running `python.exe -m pip install --upgrade pip`
6. Install the required dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`
7. Configure database settings(pick sqlite3 or json) in the config.py file found in configuration file.
8. Run main.py located finance-project folder
9. Check [swagger](http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs). 

## Technology Stack
Leveraging modern tools such as FastAPI, Uvicorn, Json and sqlit3 as databases along with integration of financial API(CoinGecko), this project showcases my skills in both backend development and fintech API integration.
Following SOLID principles, employing design patterns, and adhering to Domain-Driven Design (DDD) concepts, I've created a robust and extensible application.

This project uses the following technologies:
* FastAPI - a modern, fast (high-performance) web framework for building APIs with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints
* Uvicorn - a lightning-fast ASGI server, built on top of the asyncio event loop
* Matplotlib - a Python library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python
* Sqlite3 - SQLite is library that implements a small, fast, self-contained, high-reliability, full-featured, SQL database engine
* CoinGecko API - cryptocurrency data API for traders and developers
